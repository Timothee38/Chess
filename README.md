# Chess

This is still under heavy development, although I have most of the infrastructure how I want it, so it's now a case of implementation and improvements

Major things that I need to do:
- Implement functionality for all pieces
- Add piece collision to prevent same colour jumping
- Work in win conditions
- Improve GUI
